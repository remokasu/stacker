# Numbers

You can directly push integers floating-point numbers onto the stack. For example, you can push numbers like 3 or 3.14.

~~~
stacker:0> 3
stacker:1> 3.14
~~~


~~~
stacker:0> 3
stacker:1> 3.14
~~~


## Adding Numbers in Stacker
The Stacker command allows you to directly push integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers onto the stack. This facilitates easy management of various types of numerical data.

## Adding Integers
~~~ bash
stacker:0> 3
[3]
~~~
In this example, the integer 3 is added to the stack.

## Adding Floating-Point Numbers
~~~ bash
stacker:1> 1.23
[1.23]
~~~
Here, the floating-point number 1.23 is added to the stack.

## Adding Complex Numbers
~~~ bash
stacker:2> 1+2j
[1+2j]
~~~
In this case, the complex number 1+2j (with a real part of 1 and an imaginary part of 2) is added to the stack. Complex numbers are denoted by combining the real and imaginary parts with a +, and the imaginary part is indicated using j.
